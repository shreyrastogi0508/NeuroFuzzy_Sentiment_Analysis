# Sentiment Analysis

Python sentiment analysis is a methodology for analyzing a piece of text to discover the sentiment hidden within it. It accomplishes this by combining machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). 
Sentiment analysis allows you to examine the feelings expressed in a piece of text.

In this machine learning project, we build a binary text classifier to classify the sentiment behind the text. 
We use the various NLP preprocessing techniques to clean the data and utilize the LSTM layers to build the text classifier.
